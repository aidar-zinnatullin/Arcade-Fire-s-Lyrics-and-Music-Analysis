The symbolism is a little obtuse but at least part of it seems to imply the song is about a couple that was once in love. They slowly grew apart, and as a last ditch effort to revitalize their relationship they start having children. The coffin full of baby dolls is the give away along with the truck. The coffin is bright and reflective, covered partly by CD's in places. I think this is the death of the couple's partying lifestyle. The babies inside are the consequences of leaving their old life behind. The truck saying NINE in bold lettering on the back, the split down the middle being vaginal in nature, and then the people in the back throwing babies out is multiple births. The couple just keep having kids to fill their loveless void.",0,"2 years ago",1511254349683,false,false,,,

In fact, he basically threatened us ‚Äì he was like, 'If you don't hurry up and mix this song, I might just steal it from you!' So we thought, well why don't we go one better, why don't you sing on our version?

No, I don't think I know better than the band. As I said previously, this song is not good (personal opinion) compared to their previous and actual work. It feels boring, it feels empty.

Like the band is really that pretentious that THEY'RE the ones writing Pitchfork and NME articles about any time one of them takes a shit. They literally announced their album was coming out THROUGH TWITTER, and it was every major music news site that projected the news. They're one of the simplest bands I know of, at least juxtaposed to their enormous success. They do weird stuff, they wear giant heads on top of their own, and they make people dress up at concerts. But they're not the ones making sure everybody knows about it, they just do what they like and people watch. The people complaining are the ones making all the hype. We get that you're cooler than everybody, and we all hardly suspect your constant reiteration about how shitty Arcade Fire is is just a sad attempt to convince yourself of it.

I've been listening to a shit ton of music in the past 29 years of my life, I've always been open minded to new ideas and progressive music genres but lately music has started to become lackluster, I blame American pop culture but who really knows. This is something I've always known, the Canadian music scene has always been full of different, weird and talented artists. And for me I'm pleased with this band seeing as the've worked hard these past 10? Years to get here. Now for those who complain about change in sound take Tegan and Sara for example, the've change their"" sound"" in every album excluding their 1st and 2nd. What I'm trying to say is try to listen to different genres and take it for what it is; now for me I barely listen to any if not zero American musicians because I find most of that music scene seems to be plagued with the I don't know how to write original songs plague. Also to harken back to what I said about Canada and the unique music scene is that almost 97% of our artists prefer writing their own songs and playing instruments in stead of just preprogrammed shit (not to shit on EDM).",2,"5 years ago",1416560019980,false,false,,,

As a society we utilize social media to show others a reflection of ourselves.\nArcade Fires title song accompanying video shows that we experience our entire lives through ‚Äúreflections‚Äù. The band does this by singing about reflective technologies in the lyrics, by showing mirror reflectors in the video, reflective symbolism in the video, and music that supports these elements.\nThe song has a stanza to each of various technologies like Facebook, CDs, computer screens, PRISM surveillance program and the Droste effect to show how instead of enhancing relationships they only show us reflections of ourselves.\nThe video reinforces these themes with the use of reflective surfaces: a reflective casket to represent the grief we feel that is not for our lost one but for ourselves, a disco ball represents our attempts to define God and Wasserman's knight of the mirrors to remind us that we are ourselves and not who we portray ourselves in social media.\nOther symbolism is used in the video that support the main theme. People are depicted in masks that crudely represent themselves. This furthers the theme of the way we are only vaguely represented in our social media interactions. Dolls are used to represent how our experiences are smaller parts of us and how they fall away from us later in life.\nLife is depicted in the video as a long dark road that we all travel causing us first to reach for one another, then to look within ourselves, and finally to look for higher purpose.\nThe song and video, although rife with symbolism, are not always meant to be taken seriously. R√©gine Chassagne sings her lines in French just because she likes singing in French. The mysterious ‚Äúnine‚Äù in the video represents the nine years it took to make the album.\nMusically the song is a step up from the band previous works. The band has stated in interviews that Reflekors‚Äô percussion sound was inspired by Haitian carnival music. Rock legend David Bowie assisted with production of the album; His influence can be heard on the title track and he sings on the title track.\nArcade fire lyricist Win Butler has spoken in interviews about his ‚Äúlife changing‚Äù visit to Haiti and Haitian influence on his art. Butler found Haitians had close social ties without the use of modern social media. Drawing on those experiences and the concept of a ‚ÄúReflective Age‚Äù from Kierkegaard‚Äôs work has inspired the ideas for the song; how social media, instead of bringing people closer, just shows them reflections of themselves.",1,"5 years ago",1416560027260,false,false,,,

Where people don't interact the way it used to be. We now all hide behind a computer monitors and cell phones screens, where people just show what they think is the best of them, but true lies behind. Internet dating, internet friendship, social networks and so on. To me they have done a great job,and these lyrics have deep meaning if one chooses to listen carefully. Our love is plastic...

Personally I ADORE this song. I'd never heard any Arcade Fire songs before this and now I've played it daily for a few weeks. I love that it's over 7 minutes. There are sections to this song that mean it isn't repetitive.I also like the crescendo, David Bowie's addition (he loves to make cameo appearances I've noticed) and...well...I like everything about this song. For most songs I find I have a preference for the verse over the chorus but not so with this. It's really floated my boat.",2,"5 years ago",1416560050666,false,false,,,

I'm thinking that the desire to relate greater importance than one actually has is one of the themes of the song.¬† Personally, I think its refreshing to see a band write about how we use virtual communication to inflate our own egos. This comment I""m making, for example, may lead me to believe that I'm making a connection with someone, but really I'm just reflecting my own opinion for self- gratification.I probably won't even come back to look at the response. Another example may be what we post on facebook. Often, we are posting more for ourselves than for others. As the song states, ""I thought I'd found a connector. Turns out it was just a reflektor."" I personally love the message.It's a major topic that very few bands are even considered discussing.

Being a huge jazz fan myself ( the late '30 to...now), I've always made sure NOT to confuse genres. Jazz musicians worked their life long to¬†become virtuosos, wich¬†is almost¬†mandatory if you want to succeed . About fourty years ago, rock music had its own virtuosos too but, as years and tastes went on, virtuosity leaned the way to a more simplyfied music but still enjoyable. None of AF musicians¬†can be call ¬´ virtuosos¬´ BUT they do compensate with a very rich approach to music, so all this to say : i beleive musical genres should not be compared to eachother. And yes, I am also a huge AF fan, play them all on guitar.....and still crazy about jazz ( but I am not good enough to¬†play some, lol).",3,"5 years ago",1416560077325,false,,,,"Ugj8ahtaeQakC3gCoAEC"

They go listen to what is popular on the radio and go listen some shit that doesn't even make lyrical sense, that has a catchy beat and go 1. on the charts. This isn't music, music isn't supposed to be that way. If at least that kinda of music were minority, but it isn't! It's POP music, and pop comes from POPULAR, and then people listen to AF and have the courage to say ""wtf did I just listen"". This wil happen also if you try to make someone listen to Beatles, Pink Floyd (Syd Barrett) etc. Of course I'm not saying that¬† everybody that dislikes those bands are all ignorant, that would really arrogant of me, but it's because most of them are.

It's not a concept of the album but it is an idea that re-occurs.""\n\nIn an alternate dimension, perhaps Arcade Fire wrote and recorded ""Deflektor"" after watching Stephen Harper's Nov. 1/13 speech at the Conservative party's biennial convention in Calgary:\n\nDEFLEKTOR\n\nAt the convention, in a prism of light\nAround us the darkness, darkness of white\nWe gathered there, and looked on a stage\nIn the deflective age\n\nEntre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore\nEntre le royaume de la droite et l'extr√™me droite\nIf this is heaven\nI don't know what it's for\nHe don't care what they say\nHe don't care\n\n[Chorus]\nI thought I found a way to enter\nHe's just a Deflektor (Deflektor)\nI thought I found the connector\nHe's just a Deflektor (Deflektor)\n\nNow the questions we ask, are deflected again\nHe's disconnected, but is he even there?\nHe came to power when I was nineteen\nAnd now we're staring at a screen\n\nEntre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore\nEntre le royaume de la droite et l'extr√™me droite\nIf this is heaven\nI need something more\nJust a place where children play\nTo call my home\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI thought I found a way to enter\nHe's just a Deflektor (Deflektor)\nI thought I found the connector\nHe's just a Deflektor (Deflektor)\nJust a Deflektor (Deflektor)\nHe's just a Deflektor (Deflektor)\n\nHe's just a Deflektor...\nJust a Deflektor...\n\nJust a deflection of a deflection\nOf a deflection of a deflection of a deflection\nBut wonder will he swallow his pride?\nHe's got some things to hide\nJust a deflection of a deflection\nOf a deflection of a deflection of a deflection\nBut wonder will he swallow his pride?\nHe's got some things to hide\nAlright, let's find out\n\nThe songs he sings, are muzac to my ears\nAt Cowboys nightclub, the sum of all fears\nI have to break free, he will not break me\nThat horrible sound\nDon't mess around\n\n[Chorus]\n\nJust a Deflektor...\n\nThought we were looking at the big connector\nTurns out he is just a Deflektor (just a Deflektor)\nThought we were looking at the big connector\nTurns out he is just a Deflektor (just a Deflektor)\nThought you were talking to the big connector\nTurns out he is just a Deflektor (just a Deflektor)\n\nHe's a Deflektor\nJust a Deflektor\nJust a Deflektor\nBut I see you on the other side\nJust a Deflektor\nBut I see you on the other side\nHe's got some things to hide\nJust a Deflektor\nBut I see you on the other side\n\n*\n""He came to power when I was nineteen/And now we're staring at a screen""\n\nthestar (dot) com/content/dam/thestar/news/insight/2013/11/08/ottawa_suffering_under_its_top_politician_too/harper_keynote_speech.jpg.size.xxlarge.letterbox.jpg",1,"5 years ago",1416560083970,false,false,,,

You see, and contrary to what some say, the lyrics are not enough hence the visual part. The whole album is about Life and Death and what goes on in between. So, as you get older, you change; little by little, you look at things differently each day. By doing so, you leave behind some of the misconception you had to make place to new ones ( dropping the baby dolls along the way). And even if we live in an era of communication, we are more alone than before, spending lots and lots of time in front of our computers. Also, the video deals with the idea that we jumps to conclusions to quickly, blinded by illusions and misunderstandings ( reflections?). Bottom line? We need to wise up and talk rather than just ¬´connect¬ª, stop judging a book by its cover, be less materialistic and more positively open to mankind.\nBut I may be wrong since we are surrounded by so many.....reflections. lol.",4,"5 years ago",1416560085673,false,,,,"Ughn8mSUgvNLTngCoAEC"

Therefore awards are essentially opinions, not facts, not a sure sign that you're talented. That is why in awards, the best don't always win.
