The eye also represents 'Eye of Providence', the 3rd eye/inner eye/single eye. (although some twist it as the evil eye and misinterpret the All Seeing Eye...LoL). It's the omnipresent eye of the creator peering into our soul, the window of the soul is also the eyes, always to do with spirit though. Whereas in many ancient cultures the blue eye was also used as protection to ward off the evil eye. The Gods Vishnu/Krishna/Shiva are blue (as with many Hindu Gods...referring to their blue aura or blue blood, blue Gods) , in egypt Amon was depicted as blue, hebrew priests wore blue and the bible has many mentions of blue in reference with God > it's why the Israeli flag is blue and white. Folklore mentions Druids wearing blue, the Maya painted their sacrifices blue in hopes for rain, the Chinese have their blue dragon etc, etc. \nFive mostly represents the elements > earth, air/wind, water, fire and spirit. Since we are electric, resonance frequency is being represented thru the 5 lines...'we' are sound waves (musical math, harmonics) manifest in this onesong/universe;) The throat (5th) chakra is blue (communication, expression & connection), while the third eye is indigo (which is still royal blue but leading into deep violet). So with auras > if one has achieved the highest form of pure perfection it is white but if one chooses to remain in action and of service to the all, it will be electric blue. Our energy can transmute/transform/transcend from lower to higher vibrations thru the blue light, sometimes seen in mediation, some also refer to it as the blue ray....but truly it all ends up with the same mystical meaning..LoL. Spiritual awakening...hey some would even call it the healing start towards enlightenment, illumination, divinity or finding God. \nBut ultimately....the only significance it has for you is the one you intuitively feel, the one you give it or what you make of it:) Everything is one and now....LoL.

Please please please consider your main stay style, and what your fans expect from an  A.F. album and whether different styles of music really fit under t hat umbrella, or whether they should be done under side projects.

I know it's so easy for people to shit on something you feel passionate about and it takes 2 seconds to say you don't like something, and months to actually create something and it's unfair, but honest feedback is important to consider.

I think the problem is they can't articulate the true reason why they dislike it, so they use that argument instead. The truth is, every album of theirs has sounded different. Neon Bible didn't sound like Funeral, The Suburbs didn't sound like Neon Bible, and Reflektor didn't sound like The Suburbs. But everyone loved those albums for the most part. \n\nEverything Now is my least favorite Arcade Fire album.  I only really like a handful of songs on it (this one, ""Everything Now"" primarily), but it's not because the album just sounds different. ""Creature Comfort"" and ""Signs of Life,"" for example, have awesome instrumentation that I really enjoyed, but the vocal melodies and the lyrics of both were really off-putting to me personally. I feel like Arcade Fire put out a half-baked record. I liked the new sound and the ideas behind the album, but felt they came up short with their execution.\n\nI obviously can't speak for everybody, but I just don't think you can write someone off as ""not a fan"" when they dislike something new. I absolutely love Arcade Fire, but I'm not down with about 60% of this album. It doesn't mean I wouldn't go see them in concert and have the time of my life.

I can't force myself to enjoy the direction this band are going in - it's simply not what I enjoy about Arcade Fire. To a lot of fans like myself, Funeral, Neon Bible and Suburbs seemed to fit together quite nicely. For me, a large chunk of reflektor felt uncomfortable to listen to. I didn't enjoy them as much. The disco/dancy/synthy stuff isn't what gravitated me towards the band. You can call that sad, say we're grovelling or say what you like. I loved this band. I still do. I love three albums of theirs - they're 3 of my favourite even. I'm very grateful the band were able to make such great music for a sustained time. \n\nOf course I expect bands to change. But it's even more short sighted to expect to like everything a band does. Eventually they'll tread waters you're not comfortable with. It doesn't mean they suddenly suck. It just means your interest and theirs are no longer aligned. But that's OK - I still have funeral, neon bible and suburbs to listen to. Any of you enjoying this new direction, have fun! Enjoy it - don't let nay sayers stop you from enjoying something. But don't dismiss people's dislike for it as not warranted neither. People have their reasons. it's taste - expecting us all to agree is fucking stupid.",5,"2 years ago",1511612706899,false,false,,,

This one and Signs Of Life have had less of an impact on me than the first two releases, but I've never enjoyed every song on their albums, there's always songs I can take or leave, and a handful I just don't enjoy at all. Such is the diversity of their records. \n\nWe may aswell say the people hating on it, hate electronic music, or want them to release another Funeral (which would be as retro, and regressive).

Funeral feels like a whimsical protest record, don't get me wrong I love that record to death, but Neon Bible just has that sad, cinematic beauty to it that makes it so unique, and it stands as a brilliant reflection of America at this point in history, yet it was written 10 years ago.

This is why Arcade Fire are the best band of the last decade! They know how to reinvent themselves, make the lyrics relevant to the times we're living in. Their first album was about sadness and the loss of several family members, the second album was purely about the Bush regime and the wars it caused, the third album was about loneliness and life in the suburbs, and how we're all commercialised,  reflector i think stands for anger and exploring the sounds of Haiti, this album is ALL about how everyone wants everything right now, capitalism and how no one is happy until they get everything they want immediately or willing to do anything to become famous.\nAlso Arcade Fire are a multi talented band of musicians.

'Hot Space' from Queen, or U2's 'Zooropa' are fun albums with some great songs on it, but a lot of their fans will call it their least favorite albums. I'm sure that plenty of fans didn't appreciate the Stones adding disco influences to 'Some Girls', or Radiohead leaving their guitars at home, when they recorded 'Kid A'. My favorite band of all times is Midnight Oil, and even I was not too crazy about their electronic sound on 'Redneck Wonderland'. Still, I agree with Ruth that bands have to evolve, and that the most exciting bands are bands that change their sound drastically every few albums. That's why the Beatles deserve their legendary status.

You can listen to the Arcade Fire songs, all day, every day. It's great music to wake up to, to play while working (out), to listen to on your headphones, to sing along with while cleaning the house, to play in your car, or to dance to at parties.

I saw them in a small venue, in early 2005, months after the release of their debut album. No distance between the audience and the band. They were standing right in front of me. The band and their equipment hardly fit the stage. During most concerts, people mainly focus on the lead singer. During the Arcade Fire show, I wouldn't know where to look, because every band member was madly abusing their instrument as if he/she wanted to demolish it, and singing so loud that you would think that their  red sweaty heads were about to explode. And after every song, band members would switch instruments, and that was not something I had seen happen before.

I understand why people might be put off by it. To me, through the marketing of the album and the disco nature of a lot of the songs I feel that they've made sort of a concept album here and they're mostly just having fun. I'm enjoying the hell out of it as these sounds sooth my soul. I think back to the reaction many people had to last year's M83 album (Junk), myself included. That album really grew on me though and while it had it's misses I find it's a bit under appreciated. I'm not put off by this new Arcade Fire though.
